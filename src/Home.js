            <h3> Build a Social Media App </h3>
            <p> If I had to recommend only one app for you to add to your portfolio, it would be a social media app. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram among other popular apps are quite sophisticated and include a ever-growing number of features to keep users engaged. On top of that, it's the kind of app you likely know best regarding how it should function.

There are a number of features common among almost all social media apps: the ability for users to make posts with text and/or media files, a live feed of those posts, enabling other users to like and comment on posts, as well as user authentication. And once you've got that down, you can add profiles for each of your users, where they can personalize their account as well as manage the users they're following.</p>

            <p>App examples: Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Reddit

Technologies to use:

Create React App or Next.js to make a dynamic UI of posts, likes, and messages
Firebase, AWS Amplify, or Hasura (using GraphQL with subscriptions) for realtime data
Serverless functions like AWS Lambda or Firebase Functions for notifications
Cloudinary or Firebase storage for uploading pictures or video</p>
