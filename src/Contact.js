            <h3> Build an Entertainment App </h3>
            <p>This is the broadest of all of the categories. What do I mean by entertainment? An app that is focused around a certain kind of media. This could be movies, podcasts, or music to name a few. Some great examples of this, respectively, would be Netflix, Audible, and Soundcloud or Spotify. If you would include art or design in this category, we could add sites like Behance or Dribbble to the list.

What's interesting about this category is that many entertainment apps border on social media apps. For example, an app like Tiktok, which features short, imaginative videos, is driven by high user engagement. Another app like YouTube is centered upon user interactions through likes, comments, and subscriptions.

Think about what type of media or entertainment mosts interests you and see if you can build a simple platform around it, where users can login and save the content that they like. After that, look into adding social elements that make it possible to add comments to that content, like it, and share it with other users on the platform.</p>
